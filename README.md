## example.js

In this file, the function `countVowels` takes in a string and returns how many vowels are in the string. 

**Bonus**: Can you refactor this function so that it does *not* use the `includes` method? How can you solve this problem using a `for` loop?

## index.js

Write a function `reverseString` that takes a string as input and returns a **new string** with the characters in **reverse order**. The function should **not modify the original string**, and you should not use the `reverse` method. 

```jsx
reverseString("Hello")      // Output: "olleH"
reverseString("JavaScript") // Output: "tpircSavaJ"
```
